# The Web Framework

This simple web framework is a study in how to put together an object-oriented TypeScript application.

The application uses a mixture of composition and inheritance in the relations between the objects, depending on what is more appropriate for each individual case.

The framework is built along the lines of logic that guided early web frameworks that used to be popular before the rise of more recent libraries / frameworks such as React. As a reference, the 'View' section of the framework has similarities to [Marionette](https://marionettejs.com/), and the 'Model' section has similarities to [Backbone.js](https://backbonejs.org/). Marionette and Backbone are commonly used together.

## Usage

I do not recommend to use this web framework in actual web app building practice, as it is very rudimentary. Instead, I recommend to use the more fully featured, already existing frameworks referred to above: Marionette and Backbone.js.
